# base showroom

_Showroom_ is the showcasing component of the open source CRIS (current research
information system) _Portfolio_. For background information on the project, visit the
[Portfolio/Showroom website](https://portfolio-showroom.ac.at/). It is developed by
the [base](https://base.uni-ak.ac.at) dev team at the
[University of Applied Arts Vienna](https://www.dieangewandte.at).

The _Showroom Backend_ is the component containing all entries and activities, which users
of Portfolio have published. Those entries are transformed to be displayed and searched
for by the Showroom Frontend.
