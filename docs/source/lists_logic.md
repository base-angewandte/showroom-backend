# Activity list generation logic

For every entity _Showroom_ provides a structured list of associated activities, which
we call _activity list_. These lists are generated based on a specific logic and the
activities in Showroom, which belong to an entity. Users can change the
visibility and ordering of the first-level sections in their generated list. But the
generation itself is fixed and follows a logic described in the _Portfolio Backend_
documentation: [Portfolio Backend docs: Lists Logic](https://portfolio-backend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lists_logic.html)
