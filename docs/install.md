# Installation guide

## Development

There are two supported ways to start the development server:

1. Start only the auxiliary servers (database and redis) in docker
   but start the django dev server locally in your virtual env. This
   is the preferred way if you actively develop this application.

2. Start everything inside docker containers. This is the "easy" way
   to start a dev server and fiddle around with it, hot reloading included.
   But you will not have the local pre-commit setup.

In both cases there are some common steps to follow:

* Install docker and docker-compose for your system

* Clone git repository and checkout branch `develop`:

    ```bash
    git clone https://basedev.uni-ak.ac.at/redmine/showroom-backend.git
    cd showroom-backend
    ```

* Check and adapt settings:

    ```bash
    # env
    cp env-skel .env
    vi .env

    # django env
    cp ./src/showroom/env-skel ./src/showroom/.env
    vi ./src/showroom/.env
    ```

Now, depending on which path you want to go, take one of the following two
subsections.

### Everything inside docker

* Make sure that the `DOCKER` variable in `./src/showroom/.env` is set to
  `TRUE`. Otherwise django will assume the postgres and redis are accessible
  on localhost ports.

* Now create the docker-compose override file:

    ```bash
    cp docker-compose.override.dev-docker.yml docker-compose.override.yml
    ```

* Start everything:

    ```bash
    make start-dev-docker
    ```

  Alternatively, if make is not installed on your system yet, you can
  also just use `docker-compose` directly:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build showroom-redis showroom-postgres showroom-django
    ```

  If you did start the service with the `docker-compose` instead of `make`, you
  might want to do the following to also get Django's debug output:

    ```bash
    docker logs -f showroom-django-dev
    ```

  To stop all services again, use `make stop` or `docker-compose down`.

### The full developer setup

* Create docker-compose override file:

    ```bash
    cp docker-compose.override.dev.yml docker-compose.override.yml
    ```

* Install latest python 3.8 and create virtualenv e.g. via `pyenv` and `pyenv-virtualenv`

* Install pip-tools and requirements in your virtualenv:

    ```bash
    pip install pip-tools
    cd src
    pip-sync requirements-dev.txt
    cd ..
    ```

* Install pre-commit hooks:

    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

* Start required services:

    ```bash
    make start-dev
    ```

* Run migration:

    ```bash
    cd src
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

* Start development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver 8500
    ```


## Production

* Update package index:

    ```bash
    # RHEL
    sudo yum update

    # Debian
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

* Install docker and docker-compose

* Change to user `base`

* Change to `/opt/base`

* Clone git repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://base@basedev.uni-ak.ac.at/redmine/showroom-backend.git
    cd showroom-backend
    ```

* Check and adapt settings:

    ```bash
    # env
    cp env-skel .env
    vi .env

    # django env
    cp ./src/showroom/env-skel ./src/showroom/.env
    vi ./src/showroom/.env
    ```

* Use `Makefile` to initialize and run project:

    ```bash
    make start init restart-gunicorn
    ```

* Install nginx and configure it accordingly (clone the `nginx` repo to `/opt/base/nginx` and follow the setup docs there)

* Adopt the CAS service to allow authentication for Showroom
  - On the server where CAS is deployed, in /opt/base/cas/src/localsettings.py
    add the showroom service in the `MAMA_CAS_SERVICES` list. Take the portfolio
    service as a reference.
  - Afterwards go to /opt/base/cas and do a quick rebuild of the CAS container:
    ```bash
    sudo docker-compose stop cas-django && sudo docker-compose up --build -d cas-django
    ```


### Notes and disclaimers on prod deployments ðŸš§ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤¬ðŸ’¡

Here are some notes on the deployment process, involving the nginx setup, but specific to the setup of Showroom.
These might help you debug and not stumble across the same obstacles over and over again:

* If this service is new and not yet configured, you will need to add at least the following files in the nginx repo:
  `showroom.conf`, `showroom-local.conf`, and `showroom-upstream.conf` as well as their testing counterparts (with a 
  `-dev`-suffix to `showroom`). Use the existing files for portfolio files as a reference.
  - If you copy and modify the portfolio files, make sure to remove the `merge_slashes off` directive, otherwise nginx
    will throw an error, because the directive already gets included in the portfolio proxy configuration
* The `templates/nginx.conf.template` file has to be adopted for the new upstreams and includes.
* According environment variable lines have to be added to `docker-compose.yaml` and `docker-compose.override.yaml`.
  - Make sure to also add a network to the override template in `docker-compose.override.base.yaml` and your actual
    override file.
* For the nginx repo on the showroom node you will only need the showroom-specific environment variables and docker
  compose override directives:
  - for the .env file only the following four have to be set:
    `BASE_HOSTNAME`, `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL`, `LETSENCRYPT_STAGING`, `SHOWROOM_STATIC`
  - the docker-compose.override.yaml should look like this (in this example for a testing server):
    ```yaml
    version: '3'
    services:
      nginx:
        environment:
          - SHOWROOM_DEV_LOCAL=
        volumes:
          - $SHOWROOM_STATIC:/showroom-static
        networks:
          showroom-backend_showroomnet:
            aliases:
              - $BASE_HOSTNAME
    networks:
      showroom-backend_showroomnet:
        external: true
    ```
* When everything is running you still have to make sure to generate the static files for showroom by doing
  `sudo docker exec showroom-django python manage.py collectstatic` on your deploy node.
  In some cases there might be an issue, e.g. when you completely redeploy showroom and
  delete its folders, while nginx is still up. Then the collectstatic will not work.
  In that case stop nginx first and and do the collectstatic before you start it again.
* When you restart the Showroom services after the nginx services are already up, and afterwards the proxy does not
  work anymore, try restarting the nginx services as well. Because it might happen sometimes that the showroom-django
  service receives a new IP, but the nginx service still uses the old IP for the showroom-django upstream.
